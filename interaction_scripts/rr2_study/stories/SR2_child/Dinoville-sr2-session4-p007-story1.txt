Once upon a time, there was a Stegosaurus named Steg and a Tyrannosaurus Rex named Rex and an Achtodon named Bailey. Bailey is a paleosaur. Paleosaurs love to swim. And they also love to eat  up in the tree tops. Rex  played. He liked to play with  Stegosaurus. He hid. And then jumped up onto Steggieosauruss back. "I'll eat you". He rode into the swamp. He fell down into it. Oh no! Then the other dinosaurs jumped over the pond. Rex was a meat eater. So he couldn't swim. The end.
