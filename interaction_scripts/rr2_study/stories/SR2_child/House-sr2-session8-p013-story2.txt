 once upon a time there was two friends that had a play date.  and the friend went to his friends house. And then he grabed one of his games  to play.  but the friend that came to his house accidentally cheated.  and the other friend  that lived at  that house  said  that  the instructions  say if you cheat that means you're out.  so he said,  not nice.  but the one that lived  at that house said, "yes it is".  I'm not making it up.  and he said  that the instructions say that.   and the other friend said, "but it was an accident".  "Instructions also say even if it's a accident you should still .  and then he started to tell his mom. And  his mom can read very well. so she read it.  and then he asked his mom  if the instructions said, if you cheat you're out.  and his mom said yes.  and then the friend said maybe we should play another game where you cheat .  and then he said, we could play tic tac toe.  so they played tic tac toe.  and then they lived happily ever after. The end.
