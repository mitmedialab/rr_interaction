Once upon a time there was a butterfly. He lived in a bush near flowers. Sometimes she would visit her friend bird who lived on a little . One day she flew onto bird thinking  he was a flower. He said, "stop it"! Come with me for tea. So they went to tea. "Now lets play hide and seek". "I'll go first", said butterfly. So she hid in her hole. Bird looked and looked.  then he looked in the tree. He came face to face with a dragon. "Ahh," he said.  he hid in a bush. The dragon said, "come back". "I just want to play". Where are you, bird? "Now let's go find my friend, butterfly". So they looked and looked, up and down. Soon it was getting nighttime. The only place we could look is her house. "Found you"! We'll play tomorrow. So all of them went home. The next morning butterfly woke up first,  then the bird, then the dragon. "Lets play hide and seek". "I'll go first". "Count". "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, ready or not here I come". "Found you" ! "My turn to count". "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten". "Found you". "Found you". "My turn to count, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight". "Found you"! "Found you"! "Found you"! Then it was nighttime. And they all went to bed. The end.
