Once upon a time there was a prince. There was a princess that loved to go in the water. Look pshh. She swam and swam and swam. And an alligator was coming to get her. And she swims backwards and forwards.  And  Mr Croc  said "Do not do that"! "You stay over here and go home and be by yourself". And he was sad. He was a baby. He wasn't Mr Croc. And he was his baby. And he went off to find  the prince. And she went off to find the king. He was hiding behind the bush. And he was squating. And she couldn't even see him until she found him. "Do not do that ever". And then the prince came and helped find him. Helped geting out of the trunk . He went on Mr Tortoises back to go for the princess.  "Thank you Mr Turtle". And she walked on the  bridge to find it. And she went to the forest and walked.   But the prince couldn't find her. And the end.
