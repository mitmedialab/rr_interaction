There was a cake shop. And there was lots and lots of cake there. One day, lots of people came to buy cake and only a little bit of it was left. And then more people came.  And the cake was all gone. So they started to make more cake, so more people could come.  And then the people who ate all the cake said, "Sorry".  And the people that worked there said, "That's OK". And they forgive them.  And then more people could buy cake. The end.
