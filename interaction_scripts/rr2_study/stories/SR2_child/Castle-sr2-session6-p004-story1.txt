I want to tell a story about a crocodile. Once upon a time there were a princess and a prince. Both walked in the tower by a crocodile. Never anyone tryed to cross the bridge. Eve went to sleep tossed them into the moat . One day a very sleepy prince came walking down the road. He saw the crocodile. And went on the other side of the  to swim across.  In no time he had rescued the prince and princess. The end.
