I am gonna tell a story about dinosaurs. Once upon a time there was three dinosaur friends. They all became family one day. Then they had a little baby who grew up to be a big kid. Then he grew up to be a big dinosaur. Then he grow up to be the highest of high. They all splashed  and played in the water. And then he went practicing swimming. And he went all the way home. The end.
