Once upon a time  there was a turtle. And they didn't like the food. But they just liked flowers. So they ate and ate the flowers. But they wanted a flower that people could eat. But they don't  have it.  So they went to live with people. And they found food. They ate all the food.  They just  ate meat, just meat because they love meat  and flowers. So they ate that stuff all of the time.  So the people thought, who knew  flowers and flowers and flower. But they ate them again. So they decided to get  packs.  So they would take the flowers.  And they each could have one  for their kids and stuff.  So  they wouldn't try again. So they went in before dark.  They were sad to say good bye to their friends. The end.
