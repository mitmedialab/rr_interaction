Once upon a time  two dinosaurs were walking through the forest playing hide and seek. " I'll count". "You hide". So the dinosaur counted. It was hard to find. But he didn't notice that he walked right past the dinosaur. "Found you". But "ah, a T rex". "Stop". "I just wanted to play". "OK". "Would you like to play hide and seek". Yes. "I'll hide". "You guys count". " I'll hide too with ". "We'll hide together". "Found you". "Found you". "Two easy find" . "Now, I'll count". "No, I'll count". "I'll count". "I" "One two three four five six seven eight, ready or not here I come". "Found you two". "You're too big to fit in there". "Where is Stegasaurus"? "Hmm". "Ow ow ow, why am I so  across this  bridge"? "Oh, sorry Stegasaurus". "I didn't mean to walk on your spikes". "You count". They had fun playing hide and seek. The end.
