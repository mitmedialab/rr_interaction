Once upon a time there was a barn. And there was a farmer that had all these different kind of animals. And  then they started playing. And they saw  that he had no animals that the farmer had . And  they started playing roughly. And the farmer tried to calm them down. But they didn't calm down  because they're too hyper. So  the farmer bought a sign that said that they should calm down. And then the animals saw the sign. And they calmed down.
