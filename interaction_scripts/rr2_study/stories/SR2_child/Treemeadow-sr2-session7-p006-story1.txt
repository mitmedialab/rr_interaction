Once upon a time there was a butterfly who lived in a forest  and a bluejay who lived in a tree  and a dragon who lived on the ground. One day  they played hide and seek. Butterfly was sick. And the butterfly felt better  after she was sick. And she sat on the flowers. And they had a good time. The end.
