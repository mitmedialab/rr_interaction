Once upon a time there was a little girl who was siting in a chair. And a cat sitted|sit on a chair. And a dog sitted on the couch. Ding dong. The little girl went to the door. "Hi". She said "hi" to the little man who got two big boxs. "I wonder what's in this one"? "Ooh, a blue ball". She tucked it in the corner. And in the other box was another kitty. "Ooh, a kitty". The end.
