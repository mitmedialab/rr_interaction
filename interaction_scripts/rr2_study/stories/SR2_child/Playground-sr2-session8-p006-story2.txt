"Whee, can I do it again"? This time . "Whee". "This time you  at the bottom". This time  was at the bottom. "OK sweetie, that's enough". "This time you ". And after awhile that's enough. "Whee, ". "I am the queen of the mountain". "No one can get me". "Oh, yes I can". "I am the mountain monster. "Rar, I am coming to pick you up and tickle you on the tummy". "One two, one two one two one two one two one two. "Now, can you play  catch"? "I want to play by myself, haha"? So the little girl ran off with her ball. "Get back here". "You'll get lost". "Hmm, maybe we could figure out a way" "Ooh, I have an idea," said the dad. "We can pass the ball by ourselves". "So our girl will come back". So we passed and passed and passed and passed and passed. "I wanna do it". "". So the little girl came down from the balcony  ball. Pass, pass pass pass pass. Now, pass pass and pass. And they all had a great time. The end.
