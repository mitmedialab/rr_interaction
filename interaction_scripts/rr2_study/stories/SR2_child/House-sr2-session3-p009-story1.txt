Once upon a time a little girl was at home all day long. And she had a puppy. And she had a cat.  the puppy chased the cat all the time. And she had a ball she played with all the time. And she had boxes. The  boxes stayed where they were all the time. One day the dog hid  under a chair. He was hoping to  pounce up and get the cat. Then for the first time the cat climbed up on the couch. And the dog tripped on a ball.  then the cat jumped out of the window and was never seen again. The end. So the dog was sad because he wanted the cat. And he jumped out of the window.  so he was never seen again.  and the girl was at home the rest of her life like she promised herself.
