Once upon a time there were three elfs. A baby named Emma. A mother named Selina. And the daddy named Daddy, I guess. "I have to go to work Selina". "Bye". He went to the spaceship and drove off. "Let's make a pie for his birthday," said Emma. "Good idea Emma," said Selina. So they baked a cake and put it in the oven. "I see Daddy"! The spaceship landed. And they all gathered around the table to  sing Happy Birthday. The end.
