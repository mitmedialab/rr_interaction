Once upon a time there was a little rabbit. And he had friends that were Turtle and  Squirrel. And he walked down and passed to them. And they played hide and seek. First, Rabbit counted. She hid her eyes. Turtle hid behind a tree. And Squirrel hid behind a bush. Rabbit looked for a very long time. Eventually, she found Squirrel. And then, she found Turtle. And then they all fell asleep because it was geting dark out. The end.
