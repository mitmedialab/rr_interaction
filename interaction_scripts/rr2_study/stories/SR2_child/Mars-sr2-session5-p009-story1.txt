Once there was a tiny alien. It had a mother, a father. The father was the tiniest. The  biggest one was the baby. The mommy was even smaller. One day, the dad  the dada went to work work in a rocket. It was his birthday. And zoom up ooh he went high above the sun. Then he hit the sun and died. The end.
