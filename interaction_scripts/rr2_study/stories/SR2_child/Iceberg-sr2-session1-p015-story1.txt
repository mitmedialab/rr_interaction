Once upon a time one penguin was named Gaga. And Gaga liked to slide up and out. And  he was scared. So he went back down and was not scared anymore. And his friend helped.  She was still  scared to climb down the ice. So  they needed help. So they got their friend, Snowy. He was a seal. And Seal was happy to see them. So they went back.  And they're up, up high because they had a elevator in the sky.  And they could go back down. So then they threw snowballs. So they were tired. So they went to sleep. By the time they woke up it was light out. Then it was morning time again.
