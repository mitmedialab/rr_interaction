There was a little penguin who lived on top of a iceberg. He loved to dance. One day another penguin came over. Da da da. Then they all went to ski in the iceberg, jumped over snowmens, and kept skiing. Ooo. They landed on top of each other before they slid off the hill. They went all the way home with the seal moving  away. Whee. They went right back up.  And the visitor saved their supper and lunch the next day. And he stayed for many days.  And they had a dance party before they went. The two dancing penguins! That is the end. Bye bye.
