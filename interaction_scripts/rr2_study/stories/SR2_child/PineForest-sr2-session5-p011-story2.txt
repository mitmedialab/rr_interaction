 I'll tell a story about  a turtle. Once upon a time a turtle  was walking down the path.  And then the  turtle walked and walked and walked|walked to the squirrels house. And then the turtle decided to have some hot cocoa  on a snowy day.  And then he had to sleepover.  And then he had that  the other day.  Then his family came back. The end.
