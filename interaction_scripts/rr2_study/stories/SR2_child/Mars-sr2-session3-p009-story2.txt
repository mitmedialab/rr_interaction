I think I'm gonna tell a story about space aliens  in a rocket ship. Once upon time  there was a space alien and his little brother and his friend . One day  while  those three aliens were playing, the rocket took off without them noticing. Higher and higher. Higher and higher, it almost touched the sun. Then it crashed down. They digged and digged but could not find it until the brother maked a good point where a point sticked out . Then they  dug it up.  and it was a rocket. The rocket  was pretty small.  so they both pulled and got in the rocket. His friends had never been in a rocket. And he just wanted to stand up  and pretend he was  an alien giant. Then his rocket started to take off again. But at first, he collapsed, down down. Clouds and dust   when it fell. This time he was hiding under a cloud. The space alien was brave enough  to move clouds. He moved the rocket  higher and higher and higher. His little brother helped. And together they both  lifted it up. And he was . And that other space alien was measureing to make sure it didn't run into the sun again.
