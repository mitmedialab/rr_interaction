I want to tell a story about a rabbit and a squirrel who were friends. Once upon a time there was a rabbit. He had a friend that was a squirrel. They liked each other very much. One day squirrel came over to the rabbits house. He was baking cookies. Then they saw a turtle. They liked to play tick tock . They both . Then they knocked down the door and opened it. He went inside looking for them. He couldn't find them anywhere until sundown. Then they poped out. "You coudn't find us"! The end.
