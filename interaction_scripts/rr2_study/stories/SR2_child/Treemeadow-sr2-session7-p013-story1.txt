Once upon a time there was a blue bird and a butterfly. They liked playing games.  But they didn't like to play with the dragon.  And once time they saw the dragon.  And they started hiding.  But the dragon was actually nice. And they didn't know that. And they started running off. But the dragon started chasing them. And then the dragon said, "I'm not bad". "I'm nice". And then they said, "Oh".  And then the dragon asked them  if he could play with them. The end.
