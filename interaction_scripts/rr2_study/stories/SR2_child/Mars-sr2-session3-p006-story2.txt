Once upon a time there was two aliens. One was the baby. One was the mommy. They were walking along one day. And they found a spaceship.  and the mommy said, "let's go use this to get away from our enemy". So they went into the spaceship. And they landed. They got out of the spaceship. Except a purple alien came.  and he was like, "can I play with you"?  and he was like, "sure". So when he got into his spaceship it was very fast. And then they took off. The end.
