And they all wanted a second story.  but then Stegosaurus  and two others  were walking. And then they saw the pond. And they went around the pond.  and they swam and swam and swam. And then they hid behind a tree.  and they said "boo" to each other.  and then they hide behind bushs and played hide and seek.  and then  they hide behind the  palm trees and played hide and seek. And then they hide behind  the trees.  and then they . They lived happily ever after.
