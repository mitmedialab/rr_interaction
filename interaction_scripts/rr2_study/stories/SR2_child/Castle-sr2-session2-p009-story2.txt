I think I'll  tell a story about the crocodile and the prince. He had  a carriage. He loved his castle. It was so big.  He liked his horsey. He had some alligators and some horseys.  The horsey come running fast.  And he could ride really fast into the gate. One day  his ride  had to go.  And they were chickens. The horsey was running . He wanted to keep riding  on its back.  But his ride creature it would be back the next day.  So he splashed him with the water. While it was gone, the princess came   and asked the king, " Do you want a ride in my carriage"? He said yes.  And she gave him a ride.  And they both lived happily ever after.
