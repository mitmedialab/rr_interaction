Once upon a time, there was a prince. And a princess wanted to get to him. But he was on the other side of a moat. And the drawbridge  was the only thing to get across the moat. But the princess was afraid that she would fall into the water.  And people said that there were crocodiles in the water. So she was too scared. And then the prince knew  that the princess wanted to have fun with him. And the princess walked  forward a little bit. And then the prince walked across the moat very carefully.  And they lived happily ever after. The end.
