I think I'll tell a story about dinosaur friends. Once there was a  dinosaur. He loved climbing trees. One day two bigger dinosaurs came. He was scared, climbed up the highest tree. But he knocked it down. So he had to climb up another very, very high tree. But he knocked it down. Bah   and splashed into a pond. They could not find him because he had hid behind a tree. The end.
