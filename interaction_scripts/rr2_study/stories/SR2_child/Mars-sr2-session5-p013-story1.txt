Once upon a time there was a family of astronauts. And they loved to play in parks. But one park was their best park that they loved to play in. But there was a bad guy that lived near it.  And it liked to bake aliens and then eat them.   So they figure outed a way to do that. But they could not.  But then the baby got a solution to that.  And he said, "Maybe we could find another playground that I would like to play in, so we don't have to play in that one". So they checked at some playgrounds. And then they found one. And then they started playing in it. The end.
