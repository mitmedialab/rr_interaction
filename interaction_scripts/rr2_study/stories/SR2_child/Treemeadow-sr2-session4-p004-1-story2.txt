Once upon a time there were two friends, a bird and the butterfly. They were two very good friends. One day the butterfly was flying. And she went over to visit the bird.  And then they saw a dragon. They both hid.  flew down. He looked all around for them. But he couldn't find them. He said, " where could everyone be"? "I just want friends". And then the bird peeked out and said, "really"? And then he came out. And the butterfly did too. And they played for the rest of the day. The dragon said, "I wanna go first". The bird and the butterfly hid. The dragon found them both. The end.
