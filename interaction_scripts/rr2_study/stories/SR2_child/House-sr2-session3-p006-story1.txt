Once upon a time a little girl was siting on the sofa. The cat was siting on the chair. And the dog was near a ball. She had boxs in the corner. She said, "I am bored" one day. "I decided to open a box". So she opened the box. And there was a ball. "Ooh, a ball". "Oh, I hope Mommy and Daddy don't get angry". So she put  the ball into the box. The end.
