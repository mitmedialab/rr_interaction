There were two girls. Micah and Julia. And they were supposed to swing on the swings. And  they did that every time they were out of school. And they loved to eat.  And then they were on the swings. And soon  they were tired. And they wanted to get off of them. They wanted to go down. And then their friend  Mike came over.  They had just finished swinging.  And they went back home. Toot toot toot toot toot toot. And they bring their balls out. Micah forget her ball  because that was up high in a tree. "I can't get it either" said Julia.  And Micah was happy again because she got her ball back. And their friend throw it down too and let them fall down. And their ages were five and four. She's four. He's five. And  she's five.  And she's six. They all went home for math from high school. And they live in their ball because if they was not. They didn't remember they were not supposed to. So  the brother came down. They went back down. It was school time again.  The end.
