 Once upon a time there was a village with fairys and princesss and kings and queens   and one ugly witch. And the witch had a green face and a long pointy nose and some poisonous stew. And she liked to kill the most magical   princess and king and queen.  So  one day they got out for a walk. But they made a little mistake. There was two paths in this . And the witch made them go to her house.  So they chose to follow the sign. And they didn't know.  And then when they got there  they saw the witchs house.  And they  came in. But they actually didn't know it was the witchs house since the witch had a new house. So they just went there. And then they saw the witch.  And the witch was not smiling  and telling them to drink the poisonous stew.  And then they drunk it.  And then the king  had to try to stop the princess and the queens had a try to kill . But the princess had already drunk the poisonous stew. And then she fell to the ground.  And then when they brought her back to the village, they brought her to a magical king. And he said, "I know I can do this". So he kissed her. And  then she came back alive. And then they lived  happily ever after. The end.
