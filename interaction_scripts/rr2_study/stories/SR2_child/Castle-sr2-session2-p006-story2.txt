Once upon a time there was a prince who had a pet crocodile. He was friends with the princess and liked to give her rides on the crocodile. So they went for a ride every day she visited. One day, the Croc said, "I am tired". "I wanna run away". So he ran  away. " But we can't have any more playdates" said the prince. "That's sad" said the princess. "Let's go talk to the croc". "La la la la". So they searched and searched for days and weeks. And one day the prince found him and said, "Over here". And then he said, "Come back here". So they rode on the croc all the way back to the castle. The end.
