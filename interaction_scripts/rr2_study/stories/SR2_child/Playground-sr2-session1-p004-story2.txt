I'll tell a story about a playground and some kids.  One day some kids were swinging on the swings. They were going back and forth and back and forth. Their friend was playing on the slide. And then  he found a ball. He started to throw it up and down, up and down, and up and down. And then, his friends came and said, "We want to play". And then she, "I'm playing by myself". "No thanks". And then they got mad. And they took the  ball. But then the other girl found another  ball and worried that the other girl might find it. So she took it away, too. And then, she said, "Bring those balls". And then the other one said, "Bring those balls back". And they went, "OK". And they threw them down. The end.
