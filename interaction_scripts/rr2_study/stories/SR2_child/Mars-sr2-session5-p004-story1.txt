Once upon a time there was a family of aliens. Yeah. Look. Oh. And they had just arrived on planet Earth. They were unpacking their things. They decided they were going to celebrate. The little  was only the littlest kid. He didn't tell mom or dad. He went right past them and made a birthday cake all by himself. Then he brought it over. And they were so surprised. They decided to go eat it on the other planet. They went back to the other planet and ate the cake. The end.
