I think  was  about butterfly. Once there was a butterfly and a bird. )) once there was a dragon and they loved to play. One day a dragon came by. "Run", said the bird. "Run", said the dragon. He flew higher and higher. But the dragon breathed fire. He almost caught him. He climbed higher and higher and higher and higher and higher. He almost went to the top. But the dragon twisted around and around and around. "I want a friend", said the dragon. "Really"? "You're not gonna eat me"? "Yes", said the dragon.  so they played  and played and played.  the end.
