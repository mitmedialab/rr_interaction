Once upon a time a seal and  two penguins were climbing up a tall mountain of ice. The seal went first and fell into a snowman. And the penguin  fell into snow.   The little penguin slid down and crashed into a little bush.  And then the next day, while they were sleeping in their beds, the seal flip flopped off the little mountain. flip flop flip flop. flip flop.  He slid down into a snowman and then bounced on its hat. The end.
