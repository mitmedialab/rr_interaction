Once upon a time there was a little girl. She had a ball. And the little girl had a ball that she really liked. It was covered in blue. And she had a dog and a cat. Cat liked climbing to the top of her chair. And the dog would sniff the chair and try and figure out which one she was on top of. Usually the dog would scare her down onto the other chair. It was big. And the dog ... actually I'm gonna tell a story about a princess. Once upon a time there was a princess. Or I'm gonna tell a story about an alien. Once upon a time there was an alien that had a rocketship. The rocket blasted off. The aliens lived there. That's their home planet . But it blasted off without them. They were puzzled. They did not know what to do. Two  and one . They went into the house  that they had bought to use. And then the rocketship  fell back onto earth. They quickly hoped into it,  all three of them.  and then when it started to blast off, they all hold onto it. The end.
