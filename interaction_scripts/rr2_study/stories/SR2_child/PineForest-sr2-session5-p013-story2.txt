  Once upon a time there was some friends, Squirrel, Turtle, and Rabbit. They liked playing with each other.  But Turtle was  still a little mean. And he had to learn more.  So Rabbit and Squirrel excluded turtle. But Turtle felt really sad about that.  So Turtle said to them, "I wanna play, too". But they won't let him.  And he said, "I think I know why you won't let me  because I don't know that much".  And they said, "That's why".  So Turtle said, "Would you teach me  how to learn, so you could not exclude me".  So they teached|teach him. And then he knew. And then he could play with them.  The end.
