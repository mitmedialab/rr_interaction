It fluttered through the skys. And it hid behind the bush  from the dragon. And a bird went out. And a butterfly flew up. And then the dragon flew up. Then the bird flew over them all and then landed on the dragons ear. The butterfly quickly  up  and flew down, with the bluejay quickly bounding behind. Then the dragon swooped up to his favorite tree and took a rest. The end.
