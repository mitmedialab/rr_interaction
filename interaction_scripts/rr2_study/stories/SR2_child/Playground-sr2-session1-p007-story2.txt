 I'm gonna tell a story about a little girl and a little boy named Jane and Will. Once upon a time there were two kids, Jane and Will. Their friend Lauren had a sister.  And she liked to play ball. And she also liked to climb up on a structure in a playground. She liked some balls.  Soon the ball hit a slide. And it went whee down to the bottom. Then, Lauren caught the ball and held on to it. And then Jane got off the swings and said, "May I have the yellow ball, please"? "Sure, " said Lauren. And she held the ball out. And then, William said, "May I please have the blue ball"? And she said, "Sure". "But if I give it to you,  I won't have a ball". So, she sadly gave it to William. And then they played ball together. The end.
