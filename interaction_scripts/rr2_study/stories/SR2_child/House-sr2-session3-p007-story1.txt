Once upon a time there was a girl who liked to play ball. The ball went up. And she caught it.  the dog said woof he liked to  catch the ball first. But one day  the little girl bought a new cat.  and the cat did not like the dog. "Meow, meow meow meow meow", which means, "get off my sofa". Then a block came,  and then another one. And they made steps for the kitten to climb down on.    The dog followed her. He wanted to chase the kitty. But then they curled up together and went to sleep. The girl sat in a chair and watched them. The ball bounced under the sofa and bounced up onto the ceiling. Then that kitty, down, down that she could go on the sofa. The dog could go in the chair. And he went to the chair. The end.
