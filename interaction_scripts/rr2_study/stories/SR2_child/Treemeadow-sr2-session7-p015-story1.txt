Once upon a time a butterfly named Lady Gaga..  Once upon a time there was a butterfly named Lady Gaga. Once upon a time there's a butterfly named Lady Gaga. And she had a friend named Zoe . And she had another friend named Chloe Zoe Rose. They played nicely all together. And all the times, really well . Butterfly did really well.  and  Dragon,  every time he plays hide and seek with them, he can't even find any of them.  He walks all the way across. But  he walks across them. And he doesn't even see them. And he sees  because  he doesn't see the butterfly. He flaps his wings. And he doesn't even see a butterfly. And she doesn't see a  butterfly. She looks. But she couldn't find him. She was right there. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.
