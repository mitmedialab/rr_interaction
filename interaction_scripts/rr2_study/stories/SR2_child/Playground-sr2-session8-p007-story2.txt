One time  there were three friends,  Micah and Isabella. Micah liked going on the swings. Isabella liked going on the slide. One time they made a new friend, Daisy. She liked ball. One time she hid behind a bush until nobody saw her. Then both of the kids that were playing, approached and hid. Then, Micah slid down the slide and saw her. She steped out but landed on the top of the brick tower.  So then, they both came down together. The end.
