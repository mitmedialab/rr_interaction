 I'm gonna do a story about buttercups and a bunny, I think. Once upon a time there was a little bunny. He liked to be chased with his friends. He didn't want to be found.  They found him. He liked to climb up. And he jumped down. And his legs stretched. And he jumped down and bounced up. He loved doing it. But his friend, Turtle, couldn't do it. His legs weren't made for jumping.  So while he's hiding  under a buttercup,  then he's jumping. She saw  that the bunnys legs were not flexible and not good for jumping. So   the bunny saw  that  she couldn't  walk as slow. So the leader of them knew  that they were watching each other. But then the squirrel came by.  And that turtle asked the squirrel what to do. They couldn't do any of their own things . The bugs are gone. The turtle told  them  to follow us. The squirrel,  he knew what to answer. He told them what to do. And he went home from there.
