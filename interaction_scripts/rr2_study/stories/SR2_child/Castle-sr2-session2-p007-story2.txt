Once upon a time there was a crocodile named Mr Croc. He stood on the bridge with  a prince on his back. And when someone came close, the crocodile ran inside and so did the prince. And when the princess crossed the bridge, sure enough, there was Croc. The princess ran away and took the left bridge. And then  he followed after. He didn't see where he went. So she just took the right. And then the prince went the right way. And they lived happily ever after. The end.
