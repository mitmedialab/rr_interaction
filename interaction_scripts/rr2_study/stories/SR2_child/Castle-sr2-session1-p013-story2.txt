Once upon a time  in the Enchanted Forest, there was a queen and a king and a princess who had  a jewel. And  there was a giant that liked taking jewels. And  sometimes he liked to  sneak in and take the  jewels. But they  bought a sword. They were fighting with the giant. And the giant didn't have a sword. But they did.  So they hurt the giant.  And then they could have  all the jewels that they had. The end.
