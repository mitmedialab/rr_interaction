Once upon a time there were aliens that were flying in outerspace. Mama said, "Let's go home". But the other aliens  wouldn't listen. "What about flying more, " he said. That the other alien wanted to do. Then the meteor would come to somewhere that was going to hit them. "Cootie"! "Cootie, where are you"? "Cootie"? And she flys and go fast. And she found the  rock.  It's right there. Then they blast off. And they have a rocketship. Blast off! The end.
