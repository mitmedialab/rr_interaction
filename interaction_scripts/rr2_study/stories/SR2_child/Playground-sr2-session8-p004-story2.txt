I'm gonna tell a story about the playground. Once upon a time there were three kids. They were all on the playground. And then  they both had balls. They got another ball and played hopscotch. They were jealous. They went down the swings instead, leaving their balls behind. Then, the  one ball and caught a ball. Then she comes back . And then she climbed to the top of play stuff. The end.
