Once upon a time there was a squirrel named Squirrel and a rabbit named Rabbit and a turtle named Turtle. They liked to  slide down the hill. Of course, Turtle was the best  because  he fliped over.  And on his shell he slid the fastest. One day, they played hide and seek. Turtle hid behind a tree. That's too hard. Rabbit hid in the snow. That was so easy. So he hid behind a bush. Squirrel was the seeker, of course. He had to find the rabbit first.  "I found you"! So they both looked and looked for Turtle. "Turtle"! "Turtle"! "Turtle, where are you"? "Turtle, where are you"? "Turtle, where are you"? "Turtle"? "Haha, I found you". "You won". "Well, it's my turn to seek".  So Squirrel hid on the ground. Rabbit hid behind some clovers. "Haha, I found you"! "Aww". "Now let's go find Squirrel". "I can't move". "I'ms too stuck". "I guess I'll have to find him by myself". "La la la la la". "Found you". "Oh". "Now let's gets Rabbit out of here". "Wait for me". "It can't move". "La la la la la". "Alright Squirrel, your turn". "My turn"? "Wahoo". " This time can you hide a different spot"? "Alright, alright". "Rabbit come out of my hiding spot"! "La la la". Rabbit was so easy to find there.  Squirrel looked and looked everywhere. But soon it got dark. Even though he found the rabbit, he couldn't find Turtle. So Turtle had to show his hiding place. The end.
