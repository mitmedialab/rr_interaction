Once upon a time, Princess Reshma attended Prince Leo's birthday party, which was at Leo's castle in a nearby kingdom. His party would be really fun, Reshma expected. So to his kingdom she traveled, but when she reached the bridge over the moat outside his castle, an crocodile was guarding it! Oh no! Reshma didn't know how to get past him and cross over the moat, but then she had an idea! "Crocodile, if you let me cross the bridge, you can come to the party, too!" "Okay!" He agreed, "and I promise not to eat anyone there." So across the bridge Reshma went, up to Leo's castle. "Hi Reshma - you're early to the party!" said Leo. "I wasn't expecting you yet - I'm still setting it up! We need flowers - can you assist me?" "Okay, I can assist. I saw many buttercups out across the river." She crossed back over the bridge to get some flowers, picking a bunch of nice yellow buttercups. On her way back inside the castle, she gave one to the crocodile, so he would look nice for the party. Reshma and Leo arranged the flowers in a lovely vase - all prepared! Then it was party time! Everyone from the kingdom attended! They all had a great party. The end!
