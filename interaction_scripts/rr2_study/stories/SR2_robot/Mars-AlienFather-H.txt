Once upon a time, a family of funny aliens lived together in an ancient house on a red planet. There was an alien father, an alien mother, and an alien child named Ella. Today was the alien father's birthday, but he still had to go to work anyway. So after he climbed into the space shuttle to head off to work, Ella and her mother prepared a surprise for when he returned! They were going to have a party, and they baked a cake to celebrate, too! Later, when Ella's mother opened the oven to see if it was done, Ella received a big whiff of chocolate! It was done! After Ella's mother took the cake out to cool, they frosted it, and then Ella waited by the window for her father to return. She waited, and waited. Eventually, he got back. "Look! His space shuttle is back!" So they got the cake ready on the counter. Then, as the alien father entered the house, he smelled a whiff of chocolate! "Did you two make a cake?" "Yes! Mother and I made it for your birthday!" "So how old am I now?" "Hmm... you're ancient! Are you a million years old now?" "Something like that," said Ella's father. Then the aliens all ate cake, having a great party! The end.
