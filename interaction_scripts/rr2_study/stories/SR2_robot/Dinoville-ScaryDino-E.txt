Once upon a time, a baby dinosaur named Matty lived by a big pond. Matty played in the clumps of grass. He played by the palm trees too. "Grrr, I am a mean and scary dinosaur! I will be king of the dinosaurs!" Matty pretended he was the scary king of the trees spanning the land by the pond. "Oh, Matty, you're too small to be scary!" said the big stegosaurus. "Watch me! I'll scare Tim! You'll see!" "You can't scare Tim." "Yes, I can!" "No, you can't." So Matty walked behind a clump of leafy bushes near Tim. Matty tried to walk softly so Tim would not hear him. Then Matty hid behind a tall leafy palm tree. He jumped out from behind the tree! "BOO!""Ah! You startled me!" But Tim was not scared. He was just startled. "Hah! See? I am scary!" said Matty. But Steggie said, "No, you're still not that scary." "But I will be scary when I'm big! My scary shadow will span the whole pond!" "Maybe..." So Matty decided to scare Steggie next. He would show Steggie how scary he could be! The end.
