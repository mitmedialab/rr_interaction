Once upon a time, Croc guarded a prince in a castle. Croc swam in the moat around the castle. And so the prince expected he would stay in the castle forever. Then one day, a princess saw the prince in the castle. "Hey prince! Are you stuck?" "Yes, I'm stuck! The mean crocodile won't let me out!" So the princess walked to the bridge spanning the moat. "Mister Croc, you aren't nice. Let out the prince!" "But the evil king said to keep the prince inside! The king's power spans the whole kingdom. I do what he says!" "No. Let the prince out! Then we can fight the evil king together!" "Well.. Okay!" So Croc let the prince out of the castle. Then the princess looked for the evil king. The prince and Croc helped. "I expect the king will try to run away!" Then the princess found the king! He was stuck in the trees! "Over here!" "Evil king! You can't get away!" But the king ran. So the prince and Croc chased. Then Croc bit off the king's head! The king could not bother anyone again. So the prince, the princess, and Croc walked back to the castle. They lived happily ever after! The end.
