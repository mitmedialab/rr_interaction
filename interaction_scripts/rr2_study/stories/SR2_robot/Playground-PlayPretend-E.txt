Once upon a time, Mia was at the playground with her friends, Ben and Kayla. Ben played on the swings, while Kayla slid down the slide. So Mia ran to the box structure and climbed up to the top. "Let's play pretend! I'm the King of the Playground. You live in my kingdom, which I rule because I'm king, and this is my castle." But then Ben ran over. "Only boys can be kings! I'm the king!" Mia frowned at him, because he was wrong! "No, I'm the king. Who cares if boys are kings! I'm the king, and now you aren't allowed in my castle!" But Ben tried to climb up the structure into her castle anyway. "Kayla!" shouted Mia. "Pass me the ball? Then I can throw it at Ben to keep him out of my castle!" Kayla slid down the slide and grabbed the blue ball. "Here!" She passed the ball to Mia. Mia threw the ball at Ben, bouncing it off his head. "You can't come in my castle unless you say I can be king!" "Aww... okay, you can be king!" "Oh good." So while Mia pretended to be king, Ben was a prince, and Kayla joined them as princess. They had many adventures! The end!
