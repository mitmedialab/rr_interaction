Once upon a time, a dragon lived in a tree. The dragon was big and purple. He always bumped into things when he flew. Sometimes he plunged to the ground. One day, he saw a butterfly fluttering in the sky. The butterfly flew gracefully. "I wonder if I could be a butterfly?" So the dragon pretended to be small and delicate, like a butterfly. He tried to flutter gracefully, but he bumped into the tree branch. That didn't work. Then the dragon saw a blue bird dip and dive in the sky. "I wonder if I could be a bird?" So the dragon pretended to be graceful like a bird. The dragon tried to dive as he flew. Instead, the dragon plunged too far! He hit a bush on the ground. That didn't work. Then the bird and the butterfly flew over. "Dragon, you don't have to be like us!" "But I bump into everything!" "But you are big and strong," the butterfly said. "Yes," the bird agreed. "You can fly so high. You never get tired!" The dragon realized he could fly in his own special way, even if he did bump into trees. "Thanks, friends!" he said. Then they all flew together. The end!
