Once upon a time, Ally played with her cat and her dog. "I wish Ryan could come over." But her mom said Ryan couldn't come over. So Ally played by herself. She sat on the sofa. "Okay, Dog. Let's pretend I'm in a magic show! You are my helper." So Ally picked up the blue ball from the rug. "I'll make this ball disappear!" She threw the ball behind the sofa. "Ta-da!" Her dog fetched the ball. "Now my helper will make the ball re-appear!" Dog came back and revealed the ball in his mouth. "Ta-da!" Then Ally picked up a box. "Now I'll make the ball hide in the box!" She put the ball in the box. "Look! The ball is gone!" Then Ally turned the box over, revealing the ball. The ball fell onto the floor. "Ta-da!" Then Ally looked at the cat. "Cat, you are supposed to clap! But the cat was asleep. Ally frowned at her cat, who did not clap. The cat snored instead. "I wish you were awake. Fine. Dog, catch!" Ally threw the ball. Her dog happily caught the ball. Then Ally took a bow. "That's the end of the magic show!" The end.
