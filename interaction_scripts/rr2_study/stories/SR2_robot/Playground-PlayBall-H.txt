Once upon a time, Micah and his friends Jan and Daisy were at the playground. Micah wanted to play ball! So he picked up the yellow ball and approached Jan. "Want to play with me?" "Okay!" Micah tossed the yellow ball to Jan. Jan passed the ball back. Toss, toss! Then Daisy approached them, saying she wanted to play, too! "Let me play!" Daisy grabbed the ball out of the air and ran away with it, climbing up to the top of the play structure. "Hey, come back! That was my ball!" said Micah. But Daisy stayed on top of the boxes and wouldn't give the ball back. "Come on, give us the ball!" Jan and Micah were upset that Daisy had taken their ball. "Please give it back?" "No! I won't!" So Jan searched around the playground until she found another ball - this blue one. "Fine, we'll play with this ball instead!" So Micah and Jan passed the ball back and forth. Daisy felt left out. She climbed down from the structure with the yellow ball, then offered the ball back. "Will you let me play with you, please?" "Well, okay." So the three kids played ball together, tossing the two balls between them. The end!
