Once upon a time, a girl named Ally was playing with her pets. "I wish Ryan could come over." But when her mom said he couldn't come over, Ally played all by herself. Perching on the edge of the sofa, she said, "Okay, Dog, let's pretend I'm a magician in a show! You can be my amazing assistant." Ally picked up the blue ball from over here on the rug, saying, "I'll make this disappear!" She tossed it behind the sofa and said, "Ta-da!" When her dog ran over to fetch it, she said, "Now my assistant will make it reappear!" On cue, Dog returned, revealing the ball in his jaws. "Ta-da," Ally said, being an amazing magician. Then she picked up a box, announcing, "Now I'll make the ball vanish in here!" So then she placed the ball into the middle of the box, and she said, "Look, it's gone!" Then Ally tipped the box upside-down to reveal the ball, which tumbled out onto the floor. "Ta-da!" Glancing over at her cat, Ally said, "Cat, you are supposed to clap!" Ally frowned at her cat, who, being asleep, did nothing but snore at her, which wasn't very helpful. "I wish you were awake. But fine - Dog, catch!" As Ally threw the ball, her dog happily jumped up high to catch it. Then Ally took a bow, and said, "that was the grand finale of the magic show!" The end.
