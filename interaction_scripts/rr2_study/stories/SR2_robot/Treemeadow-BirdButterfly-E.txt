Once upon a time, a blue bird and an orange butterfly were friends. The butterfly landed on flowers. She fluttered around in the sky. One day, the butterfly fluttered to the tree to see her friend, blue bird. The bird made tea and cookies in the tree for them to eat. But then the bird saw a dragon in the grass! "Oh no! The dragon might eat us! Quick, hide!" So the butterfly and the bird flew down behind a bush in the grass. The dragon couldn't see them. "Shh!" said the bird. "Don't reveal where we are!" The dragon looked around. Then he flew up to the tree. "I wonder where everyone is? I just want to find someone to play with!" The bird looked out from behind the bush. "Really? I like to play." "Let's be friends! We can play together!" So the bird and the butterfly revealed themselves. The three animals played hide and seek together. They took turns hiding behind the trees and the bushes in the grass. "I'll go first!" So the dragon and bird hid. The butterfly hid her eyes. She was the seeker. "I wonder where you are.... Found you! Found you!" The animals had lots of fun. The end.
