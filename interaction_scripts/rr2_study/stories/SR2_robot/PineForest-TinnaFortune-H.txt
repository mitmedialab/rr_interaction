Once upon a time, a turtle named Tinna headed out on an adventure! She sought the ancient, wise rabbit, who lived in the forest of spruce trees, telling fortunes. So Tinna began traveling through the forest to find the rabbit. After walking and walking, she discovered a squirrel! "Oh squirrel, where can I find the wise rabbit? For I want to speak to her and ask my fortune." "If you keep going down this path, you'll find the wise rabbit," the squirrel said. So Tinna kept crawling along, going and going. She spied many pretty yellow flowers along the path, so she picked one to give to the wise rabbit. Then Tinna kept walking. She walked and walked, because turtles are slow. When she got hungry, the squirrel hopped down from where it had been sitting in a spruce tree, handing her some nuts to munch on. Then Tinna stumbled upon a rabbit! "Are you the ancient, wise rabbit?" "Yes, I am!" "I brought you a flower, so now, will you tell me my fortune?" "Ah, young turtle. Don't you know? Only you can discover your fortune." "That's not fair!" "Your fortune is what you make it, young turtle." Tinna thought about that. "Okay," she said. So Tinna departed to go off to create her own fortune. The end.
