Once upon a time, two dinosaurs, Bailey and Steg, lived beside a pond. Being tall, Bailey munched from the leafy palm trees, while Steg, who was short, gobbled up the clumps of grass. But a meat-eater named Momo snuck over to their home as well. He liked to eat dinosaurs like Steg and Bailey. So one day, Momo was going hunting to get food, because he was hungry! Bailey, being afraid, dashed away as swiftly as she could! She was really speedy even though she was big, so when Momo the meat-eater chased after her, he couldn't catch up with her at all. So he decided to go after Steg instead, who was scared. Too slow to run away, he went up a palm tree to escape, but he was followed! So he dove out to get to the water, plunging all the way to the bottom, then swimming back up to the surface. Momo was still perched up in the tree, still looking for him! Steg could escape! So he scampered away, hiding as quietly as he could behind a clump of bushes while Momo jumped from the tree to chase after him. Momo plunged to the bottom of the water. While he was underwater, Steg joined Bailey in the distant trees. When Momo emerged, he could not find Steg or Bailey anywhere! The two were safe! The end.
