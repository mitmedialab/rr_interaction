Once upon a time, two friends, a blue bird and an orange butterfly, lived by a meadow. The butterfly liked fluttering around in the sky and dipping down to the flowers. One day, she fluttered up to visit her favorite friend, the blue bird. They were snacking on tea and cookies, perched on a tree branch, when they suddenly spied a dragon down below in the meadow! "Oh no, it might eat us! Quick, we should hide!" So the butterfly and the bird swooped down behind a bush, where the dragon couldn't see them. "Ssh, don't reveal where we are!" said the bird. The dragon came down from the opposite tree, wondering, "where is everyone? I just came here to find someone who might want to play!" The bird cautiously popped his head out from behind the bush to see the dragon. "Really? I like to play." "Oh, good! Let's all be friends and then we can all play together!" So the bird and butterfly both popped out from behind the bush, revealing themselves to the dragon. Then, deciding to play hide and seek together, the three animals took turns hiding behind the bushes. "I'll go first!" So the dragon and bird both hid while the butterfly hid her eyes so she could not see. "I wonder where you are.... Found you! Found you!" The three animals had a delightful time! The end.
