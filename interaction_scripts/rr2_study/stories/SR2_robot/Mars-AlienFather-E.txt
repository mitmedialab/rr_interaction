Once upon a time, an alien mother, alien father, and an alien kid named Ella lived in an ancient house on a red planet. Today was the alien father's birthday! But he had to work. So the alien father climbed into the space shuttle. Then he flew to work. While he was at work, Ella and her mother baked a surprise! They baked a birthday cake! The cake was for the father's birthday party. Ella's mother put the cake in the oven. Later, Ella's mother opened the oven to see the cake. Ella smelled a big whiff of chocolate! The cake was done! Ella waited by the door for her father to get back. Ella waited and waited. Then she saw her father fly home! "Look, Father's space shuttle!" The alien father walked in the door. He smelled a whiff of chocolate! "Did you make a cake?" "Yes! We baked a cake for your birthday!" "How old am I now?" "You're ancient! Are you a million years old?" "Almost a million," said Ella's father. Then the aliens ate cake! They had a great birthday party. The end.
