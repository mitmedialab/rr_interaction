Once upon a time, two dinosaurs named Bailey and Steg lived by a pond. Bailey was tall. Bailey ate the palm trees. Steg was short. Steg ate the clumps of grass. But a meat-eater named Momo walked to the pond, too! Momo ate dinosaurs like Steg and Bailey. So one day, Momo was hunting! He was really hungry. Bailey was scared. So Bailey ran away as fast as she could run. Momo chased her. But Bailey was both big and fast. Momo the meat-eater couldn't catch her. So Momo ran after Steg instead. Steg was scared! He was slow, so he could not run. Steg climbed a palm tree to get away. But Momo followed him! So Steg jumped from the tree into the water! Steg plunged to the bottom of the pond. Then he swam to the top of the water. Momo was still in the tree! Steg could get away. So Steg hid behind a clump of bushes. Momo jumped into the pond from the tree. He plunged to the bottom of the pond! While Momo was underwater, Steg ran to Bailey in the trees. Momo climbed out of the pond. He could not see Steg or Bailey anywhere! The dinosaurs were safe! The end.
