Once upon a time, a rabbit by the name of Floppy lived in the woods with his friends, Turtle and Squirrel, where they enjoyed playing hide-and-seek together. This time, Squirrel was seeking, so he went to hide his eyes while the other two hid. So Floppy snuck behind a spruce tree, pretending to be a buttercup. Turtle, hiding behind a bush, tried hard to look like a rock. Searching and searching, Squirrel couldn't discover either of them! Then Squirrel bumped into Turtle: "Oh! I thought you were a rock!" Turtle laughed, since he was the best at hiding! But Squirrel still hadn't found Floppy, so off he went, searching more. "Where are you, Floppy," he asked. Then, spotting the tip of one of Floppy's long gray ears peeking out from the edge of the tree, he shouted, "There you are! I found you!" "Now you two go hide." Thinking hard, Floppy decided to sneak over behind a different spruce tree to hide by a patch of buttercups, where Turtle couldn't spot him! Squirrel scampered up a tree to perch on a branch. Turtle, who couldn't see up that high, couldn't discover him, either! He looked for hours, then, again, he spotted Floppy's ear from behind the tree! "I found you!" Turtle still couldn't find Squirrel, though, so eventually, because it was getting dark and they were all getting sleepy, Squirrel had to show his hiding place. Squirrel won the game! The end.
