Once upon a time, two green aliens were traveling through space when their space shuttle broke down, causing them to crash land on a big red planet! So the aliens set out across the red rocks to find help, walking until the big alien caught a whiff of cookies! "Hey, someone is baking cookies! Come on!" "Look, a house, up there!" They went up the hill, knocking on the door after arriving. A blue alien opened the door. "Hi!" "Hi! Can you help us fix our ship?" The small green alien, leaning forward, took a big whiff of air - "and are you baking cookies? They smell so good!" "Yes! Have a cookie!" However, the blue alien had concocted a secret plan! The cookies put the green aliens to sleep, allowing the blue alien to sneak out and board the space shuttle! He was going to steal it! But, just in time, the green aliens awoke, and running after him, shouted, "Hey, wait!" So the blue alien tried to take off to escape, but the ship was broken! So the green aliens boarded too, saying, "Don't take our ship!" "But I'm tired of this place; I'd like to travel somewhere else!" "Well, if you help us fix the ship, we'll take you with us wherever we go!" "Okay!" So, fixing the ship together, they all flew away! The end.
