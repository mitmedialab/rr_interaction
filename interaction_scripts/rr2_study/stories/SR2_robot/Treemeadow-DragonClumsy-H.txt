Once upon a time, a big, purple dragon lived up high in a tree. Being very clumsy, he always bumped into things when he flew around, sometimes plunging to the ground. One day, while perching in his tree, the dragon watched a butterfly fluttering in the sky. The butterfly flew very gracefully. "I wonder what it's like to be a butterfly?" So the dragon pretended to be small and delicate, like a butterfly. He tried to flutter gracefully, but instead he bumped into the tree branch, hitting his head. That didn't work. Then he spotted a blue bird dipping and swooping in the sky. "I wonder what it's like to be a bird?" So, pretending to be graceful like a bird, the dragon tried to dive as he flew. Instead, he plunged too far, hitting a bush on the ground. That didn't work. "What should I do?" As the bird and the butterfly flew over, they said, "Dragon, you don't have to be like us!" "But I bump into everything - I'm so clumsy!" "I wish I could be like you," said the butterfly, "so I would be big and strong." "Yes," agreed the bird, "you can fly so high and you never get tired!" The dragon realized that he, too, could fly in his own special way, even if he was clumsy. "Thanks, friends!" he said, and then they all flew around together! The end!
