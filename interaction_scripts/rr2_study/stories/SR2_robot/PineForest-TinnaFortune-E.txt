Once upon a time, Tinna the turtle started on an adventure! She wanted to find the ancient, wise rabbit.  The rabbit told fortunes in the spruce tree forest. So Tinna walked through the forest. Tinna walked and walked. Then she discovered a squirrel. "Oh squirrel, where can I find the wise rabbit? I want to speak to her and ask her my fortune." "Keep walking down this path and you'll find the wise rabbit," said the squirrel. So Tinna kept walking. She saw many pretty yellow flowers. She picked a flower for the wise rabbit. Then she kept walking. She walked and walked. Turtles are slow, you see. Then Tinna was hungry. So the squirrel jumped from a spruce tree and gave Tinna some nuts to eat. Then Tinna found a rabbit! "Are you the ancient, wise rabbit?" "Yes, I am!" said the rabbit. "I brought you flower. What is my fortune?' "Ah, young turtle! Only you can discover your fortune!" "That's not fair." "You make your own fortune!" So Tinna said, "Okay." Then Tinna left and walked off to make her own fortune. The end.
