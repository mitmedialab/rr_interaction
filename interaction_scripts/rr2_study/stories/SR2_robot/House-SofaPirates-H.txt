Once upon a time, a girl named Emma was playing in her living room with her dog and her cat. "I wish I was a pirate!" said Emma. So, pretending the sofa was a pirate ship, Emma proclaimed herself captain. Balancing up on top of the armrest, she gazed out at the ocean, which was actually just the rug. Her dog, the first mate, jumped up next to her on the sofa. "Woof!" Then Emma placed her cat on a chair, which was the enemy ship! She gave the cat two boxes that she pretended were treasure chests. Then, going back to her own pirate ship, she pretended to sail away. "Okay, Dog, we're sailing now! Ahoy!" she yelled at the cat, who sailed the enemy ship across the ocean. "Prepare to be boarded!". Emma and the dog scampered over across the floor, hopping onto the enemy ship as fast as they could. "Ahoy! Surrender! We have boarded your ship!" Tossing the cat overboard onto the floor, Emma and the dog plundered the treasure and returned with all of it to their own pirate ship! "Don't you wish you were a pirate, too, Cat? Then you could join us on our grand adventures!" "Meow!" Then Emma and her first mate dog sailed off with the loot, leaving the cat behind, who just fell asleep again anyway. The end.
