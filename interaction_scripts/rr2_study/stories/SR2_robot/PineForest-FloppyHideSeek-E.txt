Once upon a time, Floppy the rabbit lived in the trees. Floppy the rabbit played hide-and-seek with his friends, Turtle and Squirrel. Squirrel was the seeker. Squirrel hid his eyes. Then Floppy hid behind a spruce tree. He pretended to be a buttercup. Turtle hid behind a bush. He pretended to be a rock. Squirrel looked and looked, but couldn't discover Squirrel or Floppy! Then Squirrel bumped into Turtle. "Oh! I thought you were a rock!" Turtle laughed. Turtle was good at hiding! But Floppy was still hidden! So Squirrel kept looking. "Where are you, Floppy?" Then Squirrel saw one of Floppy's long gray ears by a tree! Floppy was behind the tree! "Found you!" "My turn! You hide." So Floppy hid behind a different spruce tree. The tree was by some buttercups. Turtle couldn't discover him! Squirrel climbed a tree and sat on a branch. Turtle couldn't see that high in the trees. So Turtle couldn't find Squirrel, either! So Turtle kept looking. He looked for hours! Then he saw Floppy's ear sticking out from behind the tree. "I found you!" But Turtle still couldn't find Squirrel. Eventually, it got dark out and they all got sleepy. So Squirrel had to show his hiding place. Squirrel had won the game! The end.
