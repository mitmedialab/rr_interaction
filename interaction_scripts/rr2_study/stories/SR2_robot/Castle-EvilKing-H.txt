Once upon a time, a prince living in a castle was captured. The prince, who expected to stay captured forever, was guarded by an evil crocodile, who swam around in the moat around the castle. Then one day, skipping down the path, came a princess from a distant kingdom! She spied the prince up in the castle. "Hey prince, are you stuck?" "Yes -- the mean crocodile won't let me go free!" So, approaching the bridge spanning the moat, the princess said, "You aren't very nice, Mister crocodile. Why aren't you letting the prince go free?" "The evil king told me not to, to keep him inside! With the king's evil power spanning the whole kingdom, disobeying him is not an option." "No, I have an idea! If you let the prince go free, then we can all battle the evil king together!" "Well... Okay!" agreed the crocodile, letting him out. Then, together, they began searching for the evil king. "I expect he will try running away!" "Hm..." "Over here!" She shouted because she had spotted the king in the nearby woods! "Evil king! You cannot escape!" But away ran the king, until the crocodile caught up and bit off the evil king's head! Defeated, never again could he bother anyone! So, returning to the castle, the prince, princess, and crocodile lived happily ever after! The end.
