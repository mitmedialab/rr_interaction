Once upon a time, two green aliens crash landed on a big red planet when their space shuttle broke down. "Oh no!" So the aliens looked for help. Then the big alien got a whiff of cookies! "Hey, someone is baking cookies! Come on!" "Look, a house, up on the hill!" The aliens walked up the hill and knocked on the house door. A blue alien opened the door. "Hi!" "Hi! Can you help us fix our ship?" The small alien leaned forward and took a big whiff of air. "Are you baking cookies? They smell so good!" "Yes! Have a cookie!" But the blue alien had a secret plan! The cookies put the green aliens to sleep. So then the blue alien snuck off to board the space shuttle! He wanted to steal it! But the green aliens woke up and ran after him. "Hey, wait!" The blue alien tried to take off in the ship! But the ship was broken. So the green aliens boarded the ship, too. "Don't take our ship!" "But I want to get off this planet!" "Well, help us fix our ship. Then we'll take you with us!" "Okay!" So the aliens all fixed the ship and flew away! The end.
