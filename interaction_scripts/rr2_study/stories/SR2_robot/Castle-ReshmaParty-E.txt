Once upon a time, Princess Reshma went to Prince Leo's birthday party. Leo lived in a castle. Reshma expected Leo's party would be really fun. So she walked to the bridge. The bridge went over the moat by the castle. Oh no! An crocodile guarded the bridge! Reshma didn't know how to get past the crocodile to cross the moat. Then she had a thought! "Crocodile, please let me cross the bridge. Then you can come to the party, too!" "Okay. And I promise not to eat anyone at the party!" So Reshma crossed the bridge and went in the castle for the party. "Hi Reshma! You're early to the party!" said Prince Leo. "I wasn't expecting you yet. I'm setting up the party! We need flowers. Can you help me?" "Okay. I can help. I saw buttercups outside." Reshma walked outside. Then she picked a bunch of nice yellow buttercups. She gave one flower to the crocodile so he would look nice for the party. Then Reshma went back to the castle. Reshma and Leo put the flowers in a nice vase for the party. Then the party started! Everyone from the kingdom was at the party! They all had a great party. The end!
