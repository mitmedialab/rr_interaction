Once upon a time, a girl named Emma played in her living room. Her dog and her cat played, too. "I wish I was a pirate!" said Emma. So Emma pretended the sofa was a pirate ship. Emma was captain. She stood up and looked out at the ocean, which was the rug. Her dog was first mate. He jumped up on the sofa next to her. "Woof!" Then Emma put her cat on a chair. The chair was the enemy ship! Emma gave the cat two boxes that were treasure chests. Then she went back to her own pirate ship. She pretended to sail. "Okay, Dog, we're sailing now! Ahoy!" she yelled at the cat. "Prepare to be boarded!". Then Emma and the dog ran over and climbed aboard the cat's ship. "Ahoy! Surrender! We have boarded your ship!" Emma tossed the cat overboard onto the floor. Emma and the dog took all the cat's treasure back to their pirate ship. "Don't you wish you were a pirate, too, Cat? Then you could come with us!" "Meow!" So Emma and the dog sailed off with the loot! The end.
